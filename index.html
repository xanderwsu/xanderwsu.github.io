          <p>While the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 CE is Pompeii‚Äôs most infamous natural disaster, there was another disaster the city was known for before the volcano popped its top: the earthquake of 62 CE. Seneca the Younger wrote about the event in his book <em>Natural Questions</em>, describing an earthquake that destroyed Pompeii and left Herculaneum barely standing.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>As the modern archaeological work has progressed in Pompeii, there is ample evidence that bears truth to the event, with many of its structures featuring damage caused by seismic activity and many restoration work-related artifacts found throughout the city.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Pompeii was a city totally surrounded by walls that predated the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius by almost 700 years.<sup></sup> Within the walls were various gates leading in and out of the city, with the northern Herculaneum Gate and the southern Stabian Gate as the likely main points of ingress and egress due to the fact that those gates had the most amount of bars and inns in their proximity, suggesting they had the most amount of traveler foot traffic.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Walking amongst a Roman street was an assault on the senses. Ancient poet Martial detailed the cacophony of sound one might experience walking through a Roman street:</p>

          <p>‚ÄúSchoolmasters deny you life in the morning, bakers at night, the hammers of the coppersmiths all day. On one hand the idle moneychanger rattles his grubby counter with Nero's metal, on the other the pounder of Spanish gold dust beats his well-worn stone with shining mallet; neither does Bellona's frenzied throng give up, nor the garruIous castaway with his swaddled trunk, nor the Jew that his mother taught to beg, nor the blear-eyed pedlar of sulphurated wares.‚Äù<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Throughout the city of Pompeii were many temples dedicated to Rome‚Äôs many gods and goddesses. The primary purpose of a temple was to house a statue of these gods whereby people could visit to lay down offerings.<sup></sup> These temples were typically quite cluttered with goods and valuables so it was likely they were well-guarded to prevent any kind of looting. In the Temple of Apollo in Pompeii, there was even looted booty from 2nd century BCE Corinth found during excavations.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>One thing you wouldn‚Äôt find in a temple, however, was the conduct of any animal sacrifices. Those would take place outside the temple, where an animal like a bull would be killed at an altar while priests or government officials recited a prayer.<sup></sup> Afterwards, some of the meat would be divided for distribution while another section would be burnt as the sacrifice to the god.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Ubiquitous throughout Pompeii‚Äôs streets were public benches. Placed around areas of congregation, such as bars and eateries, the majority of benches were never more than roughly 30 feet away from another bench, and a significant amount of the benches were placed on the southern side of the street in the shade from the hot Roman sun, offering a cool spot to rest and socialize with others.<sup></sup> Snobbish ancient authors created a term for the loitering, lazy Romans sitting on shaded benches: <em>umbratici</em>, literally translated, ‚Äúshady characters.‚Äù<sup></sup>

          <p>Benches were also more frequently placed in areas of high traffic facing the busy streets, as opposed to more quiet and secluded areas such as back alleys, suggesting they were positioned with another favorite human pastime in mind: people-watching.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Archaeologists have so far uncovered over 140 food and drink sites and 30 plus bakeries, which meant there was roughly one spot to eat or drink for every 55-90 Pompeiians.<sup></sup> These were small establishments, averaging around 350 sq ft of floor space and precious little seating, so most eating and drinking would occur outside of the venue on one of the many benches that lined the streets.<sup></sup> Not only could you fill yourself with food and wine but many of these places were also sources of finding a prostitute or partaking in some gambling.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Bread was the staple food of Pompeii with over thirty bakeries discovered thus far.<sup></sup> Some of these were on a commercial scale, such as the Bakery of the Chaste Lovers, where slaves or mules milled the flour in one of four mills, slaves prepared the dough and baked the bread in gigantic ovens, and loaves delivered by mule to customers or handed out at a bread stall elsewhere in the city.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>The bread of Pompeii is made simply with flour, salt, sugar, and water. Carbonized loaves have been discovered in Pompeii and we can see that bakers cut the loaves into eight pieces, like a pizza, and would tie a rope around the circumference, likely to make it easily portable for the customers.<sup></sup> The British Museum has a video tutorial if you‚Äôd like to try to make your own!</p>

          <p>Politics appears to have dominated the Pompeiian social scene. Every year, four magistrates were elected: two duumvir and two aedile, with the latter being more of a junior position to the former.<sup></sup> Together they would fill and oversee the town council, a body that would operate the civic management of Pompeii, such as the building of public spaces or managing the treasury. Being a councillor granted one certain privileges, such as the best seating at public events. However, the role of duumvir trumped them all, which is likely why archaeologists have unearthed over 2,500 campaign posters throughout the city of Pompeii, a town of roughly 12,000 people.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Most of these posters are rather plainly stated slogans: ‚ÄúI beg you to elect Publius Furius duumvir, a good man.‚Äù<sup></sup> Sometimes a little more, but not much, will be added, such as ‚ÄúHe brings good bread,‚Äù or ‚Äúgreat giver of games.‚Äù We even have examples of negative or satirical ads: ‚ÄúThe little thieves ask for Vatia as aedile‚Äù<sup></sup> and ‚ÄúThe dice-throwers ask for Cn. Helvius Sabinus.‚Äù<sup></sup></p>

          <p>In the image posted in this scroll is a real ad for Gnaeus (Cn.) Helvium Sabinum and the D-R-P-O-V-F is an abbreviation for <em>Dignum Rei Publicae</em> (worthy of public office) <em>Oro Vos Faciatis</em> (I beg you to elect).<sup></sup></p>

          <p>To bathe is to be Roman and like the rest of the empire, Pompeii featured a multitude of commercial and private baths, although most were in a state of disrepair ever since the great earthquake of 62 CE.<sup></sup> A bathing complex would be a place to socialize and relax while enjoying a steam, a scrub down, a massage, some sunbathing, and even games played with a ball.<sup></sup> They were the ultimate source of Roman R&R.</p>

          <p>Baths are also considered a great social equalizer, as everyone visited the baths, from the rich to the poor, the elite and the enslaved, even emperors would visit public baths.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Despite the immense importance of bathing in Roman society, the bathwater itself was surprisingly a disgusting cesspool by modern standards. It was not chemically treated like our modern pools and the water was only infrequently changed, thus leaving behind all the dirt, grim, and bacteria of all the people who entered it.<sup></sup> Even Roman medical professionals would advise to not enter a bath with an open wound lest they wish to contract an infection and gangrene.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>While prostitutes could be found all around the city, typically at the nearest watering hole with one of the barmaids, it appears likely there was only one single purpose-made <em>lupanar</em>, or brothel, in Pompeii.<sup></sup> It‚Äôs the only building in Pompeii that has multiple rooms featuring masonry beds, sexually graphic frescoes, and are covered in sex-related graffiti.<sup></sup> Additionally, it appears to have other rooms that were more for socializing over a drink, indicating that perhaps clients were looking for more than just a quick release but a more intimate experience with a friendly lady.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>While prostitutes and pimps were seen to be of a lower class and had less rights than other Roman citizens, clients did not suffer socially for paying for sex.<sup></sup> In fact, even Cato the Elder, well known in history for his moral conservatism, is attributed to have once praised a young man for visiting a brothel, choosing to release his urges with a prostitute over sullying someone‚Äôs wife.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Although your average Pompeiian lacked the space to grow cattle for food, there is evidence that some still managed to raise livestock for consumption. Found in Pompeii are <em>glirariums</em>, or dormouse jars, which were terracotta jars that housed mouse-like rodents for the intended purpose of fattening them up for consumption. The jars were poked with air holes and fitted with a lid to keep the dormouse in darkness, perhaps to induce them into sleeping and growing fat as opposed to muscle. Inside were layered ledges for running in circles and food trays that could be filled from openings on the outside. Multiple recipes have been discovered in Roman cookbooks, including stuffing the dormice with pork, pepper, nuts, fennel, and fish sauce or simply dipping them in honey and topping with sesame seeds.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Perhaps Pompeii‚Äôs most important venue in the city was its amphitheater. An outdoor venue that seated 20,000 people, it played host to a variety of events, from man-on-man gladiatorial combat, man vs. beast ‚Äúhunts,‚Äù athletic displays, and perhaps even pantomimes.<sup></sup> Special marbled front-row seating was reserved for the most elite of Pompeii‚Äôs citizens who had their own private entrance to prevent mingling with the public.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>Much like modern-day boxers, gladiators were represented by a manager that booked their fights and provided their training.<sup></sup> Gladiators were primarily slaves and condemned criminals with a small amount being volunteers.<sup></sup> They appear to have lived communally in a type of gladiatorial barracks, two of which have been found in Pompeii full of a healthy supply of equipment such as weapons, helmets, and shinguards.</p>

          <p>Combat wasn‚Äôt as deadly as popular opinion may believe; there is evidence of games taking place without a single gladiator being killed, with all defeated opponents granted a reprieve.<sup></sup> Still, analysis of stats that have been found in the graffiti record so far would suggest 1 in 6 gladiators would die each show.</p>

          <p>The only surviving eyewitness account of the eruption comes from Pliny the Younger, who watched the events unfold from his home on the other side of the Bay of Naples. In a personal letter he wrote around thirty years after the event, he describes first noticing the large cloud of ash emanating from Mt. Vesuvius early in the afternoon although it is likely it started much earlier.<sup></sup> This gigantic cloud of ash and pumice (light, porous rocks) had risen nine miles into the sky and would begin to deposit six inches of debris onto the city of Pompeii <em>every hour</em>.<sup></sup></p>

          <p>At roughly six in the morning, it was now Pompeii‚Äôs turn to bear the brunt of pyroclastic surges.<sup></sup> The first was actually repelled by Pompeii‚Äôs centuries-old city walls and granted them a reprieve of about an hour, but the next two would flow over the walls and begin to take the lives of the remaining survivors. While not as hot as the surges that took out the citizens of Herculaneum, they were just as deadly but probably more excruciatingly so as instead of instantly vaporizing, Pompeiians burned to death and asphyxiated on the noxious gases.<sup></sup> Since these surges were not as hot and thus did not carbonize human flesh, they allowed the remains to leave imprints in the volcanic ash that future archaeologists would be able to fill with plaster and make molds that give us the dramatic casts we see in museums throughout the world today.<sup></sup></p>
